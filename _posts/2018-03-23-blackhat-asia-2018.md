We were very excited to be presenting Archery tool at one of the top information security conferences [BlackHat Aisa 2018 Arsenal](https://www.blackhat.com/asia-18/arsenal/schedule/index.html#archery---open-source-vulnerability-assessment-and-management-9837) in Singapore. It also has been great opportunity to catch up with other folks who have been working on Open Source security tool that helps security professionals.
